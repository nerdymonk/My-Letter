# Dear Faith Pius,

I often find myself reminiscing about that special moment we shared in the hotel (at least it was for me). For me that kiss sparked a deeper connection between us and it's been unforgettable. It was as if time stood still, and all that mattered was the two of us, lost in that moment.

Since then, I've had the pleasure of getting to know you better, and I'm captivated by your lovely personality, your infectious fun, and your adorable smile. Being around you makes my day brighter, and I feel grateful to have come across you in my life.

I like how i really connect with you so effortlessly and how we occasionally share laughs together. 

Seeing you makes my days brighter, and I just wanted to appreciateÂ you.
