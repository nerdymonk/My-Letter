# Dear Sarah Oyinkansola,

Sarah, Where do I even begin? From the moment you approached me at CDS, I knew you were someone special. Your kindness, compassion, and beauty captivated me.

That birthday bracelet you gave me is more than just a gift - it's a reminder of your thoughtfulness and generosity. I've worn it every day since, feeling grateful for our connection.

Our picnic adventure was unforgettable, your office outing turned into a sweet escape, and I cherish the memories we shared together.

But what I cherish most is the spark between us. Our time at your office was electrifying - those kisses still leaves me breathless. Time indeed stood still.

Sarah, you're an incredible woman, and I'm so lucky to have you in my life. Your beauty shines from within, and your heart is pure gold. I'm excited to see what the future holds for us my dear Oily Puff Puff.

With love and appreciation,
